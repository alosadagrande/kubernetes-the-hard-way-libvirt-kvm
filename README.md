# Kubernetes The Hard Way (Libvirt KVM edition)

This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way. This guide
is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a
Kubernetes cluster. If that's you then check out the
[Getting Started Guides](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long
route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes
cluster.

> The results of this tutorial should not be viewed as production ready, and
may receive limited support from the community, but don't let that stop you
from learning!

## Differences with the original kubernetes-the-hard-way and others

> **Note:** This tutorial has been forked from [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) wrote by Kelsey Hightower and it is based also on [Kubernetes The Hard Way (Openstack Edition)](https://github.com/e-minguez/kubernetes-the-hard-way-openstack) by Eduardo MÃ­nguez. Special thanks to both.

The main difference is that instead of running our cluster on top of an IaaS solution as Google Cloud or OpenStack, we aim to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a baremetal server. We will leverage the virtualization capabilities that come with GNU/Linux (libvirt/KVM/QEMU) to easily provide a similar *virtual infrastructure*. Note that we can use any spare baremetal server or laptop (with enough resources) running a GNU/Linux distribution.

Some other differences in this installation comparing to the original one:

* CentOS 7/8 instead Ubuntu as the operating system of the instances.
* Dedicated instance for load balancing (with HAProxy).

## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is someone planning to support a
production Kubernetes cluster and who wants to understand how everything fits
together.

## Cluster Details

Kubernetes The Hard Way guides you through bootstrapping a highly available
Kubernetes cluster with end-to-end encryption between components and RBAC
authentication.

* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) 1.16.2
* [containerd Container Runtime](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) 1.3.0
* [coredns](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) v1.6.2

## Labs

This tutorial assumes you have access to a Baremetal Server. While KVM is
used for basic infrastructure requirements, the lessons learned in this tutorial
can be applied to other platforms.
