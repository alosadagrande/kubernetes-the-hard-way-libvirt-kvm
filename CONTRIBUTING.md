This project is made possible by contributors like YOU! While all contributions are welcomed, please be sure and follow the following suggestions to help your PR get merged.

## Words

This repository is a fork of the [@kelseyhightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower) tutorial "Kubernetes the hard way". Modifications are basically based on infrastructure changes so that it can be deployed using libvirt.

## License

This project uses an [Apache license](LICENSE). Be sure you're comfortable with the implications of that before working up a patch.

## Review and merge process

Review and merge duties are managed by [@alosadagrande](https://github.com/alosadagrande). Expect some burden of proof for demonstrating the marginal value of adding new content to the tutorial.

## Notes on minutiae

If you find a bug that breaks the guide, please do submit it. If you are considering a minor copy edit for tone, grammar, or simple inconsistent whitespace, consider the tradeoff between maintainer time and community benefit before investing too much of your time.
